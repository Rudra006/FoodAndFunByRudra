# FoodAndFunByRudra
I created an interactive frontend for the "Food and Fun" website using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Through responsive design, I elevated user engagement and aesthetics. Additionally, I incorporated a backend using PHP and MySQL for seamless data management, further enhancing the website's functionality and user experience.
